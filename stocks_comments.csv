apps suddenly do not work, networks suddenly cannot be reached or orders suddenly cannot be placed. 

they cannot beat us, thats why they block us. I am 100% sure this is illegal, but almost impossible to prove. 

most have clauses in their TOS and agreements stating something like ""mistrades"" which negates trades under ""suspiscious circumstances"".

COPY AND PASTE THE FOLLOWING TO SEND YOUR CONGRESSMEMBERS:

Dear Honorable Representative/Senator,

I am writing to you today because of the recent events that occurred in the stock market. Specifically, the surge of Gamestops’ stock price. As an average U.S. citizen, it is inherently corrupt to restrict my ability to make decisions regarding stocks while large financial institutions and investors can operate without the exact same restrictions I face. 

Action must be taken to provide power to the players, who work minimum wage jobs, those in college loan defaults, and simply want to change the market to benefit the average person. It is not okay to protect these large financial institutions and brokerages who place profits over people.

I would like to see you act on the topic of market manipulation by these large financial institutions. Please stand up for your constituents, those who elected you to protect and serve our democracy. 

Do not let donations from these institutions and big money steer your own moral compass. I look forward to your response and how you choose to act in this situation.

Thank you.",t3_l6uva1

First, in your Robinhood agreement there is a clause allowing them to restrict trades for basically any reason at all. 

Second, they, and other trading platforms, are not market makers and dont have a seat on the NYSE.  This means they send your trade to a market maker to fulfill.  They do this because they make money off of order flow.

Who do the orders go through?  Two Sigma, Citadel, and Virtu, amongst others.

Those market makers decide what order flow they will accept.  They can tell any ""Broker"" (which is what Robin Hood is) that they will not accept any type of order they choose.  Thats not technically manipulation.

If you have a seat on the NYSE or you are a market maker, you can still buy or sell GME whenever you want.

Complain all youd like, this is 100% legal, and Ive been telling people how dangerous this is for days and everyone downvotes me to the grave.

I think its fucked and shady 100%.  I want to stick it to the man.  But you need to know how to play the game to win it, and too many of you are inexperienced traders to play it right.

If you all wanted to start a WSB market maker with a seat on the NYSE you could pay the roughly $100,000 to get the seat and pay the respective compliance costs, then build the trading platform to do it.  Its actually not even that hard to do.

Edit:  I 100% think this behavior is immoral and shitty, I am just trying to help people understand what is going on.  Fuck these guys.

Edit 2:  Turns out they couldnt send orders through the intermediaries bc they were requiring excess capital to continue transacting.  Robin hood drew all their credit lines down and lacked the liquidity to pony up dough to the intermediaries to transact.

Very shady stuff!,t3_l6uva1
242,gl5mc2y,t3_l6uva1,The reality is that anyone coming in at these levels of GME is likely going to lose a ton of money.,t3_l6uva1
243,gl5n4hq,t3_l6uva1,"robinhood will let you put every dime you have into weekly options, they don't give a FUCK about your risk, they're protecting shorting hedge funds. this is the most blatantly naked class warfare we've witnessed in decades.",t3_l6uva1
244,gl6gix2,t3_l6uva1,"I don't see how apps like Trading 212, Robinhood, Citadel etc. think that this will solve their real big problem. GME and AMC stock is not the war, it's only a battle. The cat is out of the bag, and people up and down the globe are starting to realise that with a co-ordinated effort with a community of enough small-time investors through zero commission apps, they can they drive the price of a stock upwards or downwards. Of course, there is an argument that this is market manipulation, but this is an unprecedented situation in more ways than one:

1. The trading apps that brokers like Robinhood, Trading 212 have given power to small time investors. Anyone can purchase options on their phone at their own discretion.
2. It was never considered by Wall Street and the stock market investment firms that internet communities like WSB could co-ordinate in such a way. If investment firms did this, then it would be 100% illegal, but the stocks are being held by ordinary people owning between thousands of shares to a single share, themselves, there's no illegality about this at all.
3. At present there are no regulations/laws that say that this isn't legal. No doubt the fat cats and hedge funders will be calling for some, but it could also be argued that hedge funds shorting stocks are no different, or worse. The aggressive shorting they participate in drives stock markets down. With enough capital they to borrow and sell stocks for shorting, they are manipulating stocks themselves. Do they really want to throw stones in a glass house. It has to be a fair game. If WSB can't do it, then the hedge funders shouldn't be allowed to either.
4. To make things even more controversial, there is an obvious conflict of interest with apps like Robinhood and Trading 212. The fact they've decided to stop allowing people to buy meme stock like Gamestop, Nokia, American Airlines etc. today was a blatant effort to stop small time investors from buying more stock whilst the hedge funders were still allowed to drive the stock down. It's obvious market manipulation, but again, this is unprecedented. These apps that have removed barriers for small investors are a relatively young concept, so it could be argued that current option buying regulations/laws are not suitable for the concept of apps like Robinhood. To make matters more interesting, companies like Citadel have an interest in making them work. So at what point does someone discuss that trading apps should be banned? 
5. Now politicians and public figures have openly come out and spoken against the behaviour of the decision to prohibit small investors buying more stock. Lawsuits are being filed. The white house is monitoring the situation. Something has to crack. What side will the government take and will they intervene? Personally I can't see Biden's administration taking a stance either way, because either they piss of the fat cats, or they take the side of Wall Street (which I doubt would be a popular move). Yet, I don't see how the government can't get involved. This is unprecedented, and judges and regulatory bodies are going to need guidance on how to act on this.
6. WSB are going to be targeting other stocks like GME in future. Today it is GME, next year, it could be Papa Johns or something. Are the trading apps just going to keep stopping people from buying stock when it doesn't suit them?

Melvin has unlimited loss potential on GME. Their shorts don't expire, naked shorting, 140$ short interest, their weekly and monthly expire on friday and all we need to do is hold onto our shares so that they can't have them and INFINITE SQUEEZE JUST FUCKING HOLD.

They got themselves into an infinite loss scenario doing illegal things because they got greedy and now all we have to do to LITERALLY NAME OUR PRICE is hold shares and not sell and they are forced to give us money infinitely, government bailout and all.

HOLDING UNTIL $69420.00 PER SHARE. Fuck you Wall Street. We're taking our fucking money back

EDIT2: I don't know a day. I don't know how long it will go. I do know that there's nothing they can do, nowhere for them to go if we hold. Then we're gonna see the stock multiply suddenly by 5, by 10, by 100 and that's the moment we're going to be making some new money millionaires all over the country. Godspeed everyone.

No one actually know this.

In a few weeks -- when GME returns to semi-sane valuation -- I predict we'll learn about how Citadel and Melvin made more money from this than they could have ever have dreamed possible, and a shitton of people on WSB will have been left holding the bag.

It's a decentralized way to version software, with the idea that no one entity holds the software. The reason why it came about was because of Linux and a dispute Linus Torvalds had with their version control host, and how the VCS host literally just up and took away the Linux source code. Linus then wrote git specifically to be decentralized - and it is, and it's saved my bacon many times because of this. While git will always be decentralized, there are three main players out in the market now whose sole purpose is to centralize git source control: Github, Bitbucket, and Gitlab. 

Even the Linux kernel uses Github, along with just about every major software out there (big and small).

Is it bad? Not entirely. It has its pros and cons. But I mention it because I feel like any attempt to decentralize stock exchanges would only provide opportunities for companies to create their own centralized system.

- - - - - - 

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.  Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: **We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.** Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1. Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.

2. Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.

3. Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4. Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5. At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6. Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7. The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: **The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.**  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital.  They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said **a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.**  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?  It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to [this remarkable (if infuriating) interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  **DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""?** Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie *Snowpiercer*?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

**TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.**

Retail Investors demand more visibility into institutional trading and borrowing. Anyone investing over 1 billion dollars (i.e. hedge funds and other investment institutions) is required to disclose their holdings to promote transparency in our markets - it's called Form 13-F. **But did you know that they only need to disclose it 4 times a year? And did you know that they don't need to disclose all of their positions?**


We the people are asking for a re-evaluation of transparency requirements for Institutional Investors. We have access to technology and data gives us new sophistication - and are beginning to understand there is a tremendous disparity in access between retail and institutional investors, and are concerned that this access is being used against us, in ways that we genuinely worry could be in flagrant violation of Securities Laws. We believe that with better access to institutional trading data, retail investors can better participate in the market when making buying and selling decisions.


**According to Form 13F (https://www.sec.gov/files/form13f.pdf), Institutional Investors only need to disclose their positions 4 times a year. Why?**


*Filing of Form 13F. A Manager must file a Form 13F report with the Commission within 45 days after the end of each calendar year and each of the first three calendar quarters of each calendar year. As required by Section 13(f)(5) of the Exchange Act, a Manager which is a bank, the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, must file with the appropriate regulatory agency for the bank a copy of every Form 13F report filed with the Commission pursuant to this subsection by or with respect to such bank. Filers who file Form 13F electronically can satisfy their obligation to file with other regulatory agencies by sending (a) a paper copy of the EDGAR filing (provided the Manager removes or blanks out the confidential access codes); (b) the filing in electronic format, if the regulatory agency with which the filing is being made has made provisions to receive filings in electronic format;*


**In your FAQ (https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm), it is clear Institutional Investors are not required to disclose short positions. Why?**


*Question 41
Q: What about short positions?
A: You should not include short positions on Form 13F. You also should not subtract your short position(s) in a security from your long position(s) in that same security; report only the long position.*

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.** 

#WE LIKE THE STOCK 

#KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

On the other hand, it's also fascinating because usually the control systems that they implement to rig the game in their favor aren't quite so visible. 

Usually it's like this: there is a $20 bill for you. You have to run a complicated obstacle course in order to get it. There's a bunch of arbitrary rules that you don't really understand and you get penalized for breaking. Oh, you wor e shoes with green shoelaces that day? That's minus a $1.50. you finished the obstacle course in less than 11 minutes and 43 seconds? That's minus $3 right there. You break a couple more rules that you didn't know were there and you grab the $20 bill. After the deductions for breaking these rules and after taxes, you're left with $7. You feel like you kind of got ripped off but at least you got your $7 at the end of the day and you're happy about that. 

Today it was like this: there's a $20 bill sitting on the table for you. You walk over and grab it. You immediately get dog piled by a half dozen men who rip the $20 bill out of your hand, beat you half to death with baseball bats, and then throw you off of the balcony.

Overall it's just really disheartening because I think we all know how this is going to play out: there's going to be some kind of kangaroo court investigation by some kind of governing body, citadel is going to admit no wrongdoing and they're going to pay a couple million dollar fine and yet walk away with hundreds of millions of dollars of profit. To them, fines like the one that is going to No doubt inevitably come of this are simply a business expenditure. In order to make x amount of profits, they need to spend y amount of money.

1006,gl6t6ga,t3_l7awnp,"💎THEY TRIPLED DOWN ON AMC SHORTING 💎 

Why the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: 

Take a look at this link ( https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme

If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.

Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!

Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

1011,gl7kw8t,t3_l7awnp,"> In the last generation most of the people thought about the stock market as something abstract and only reserved to the richest getting richer, only having a clue about what Wall Street is thanks to movies.

I don't know if that's entirely true, I've been playing the markets since the 1990s, probably my mid-30s. I was in software development and a lot of us started getting into it because that was when you first were able to trade stocks online. But then you did say ""most people"", so you could still be right.

Before the 1990s, you had to have a broker, like an actual person, and one person with a business card, not an interchangeable call center contact. You could only buy in 100 unit blocks, and you had to have your money all set up, and there were fairly high minimums just to be allowed to trade, it was a big hassle. Most people were in the market anyway, with mutual funds in their 401K plans. You couldn't really trade, but you could at least participate in the market, so most people in that situation would follow the stock market. 

I remember when a real estate bubble popped in 1987, a sell off started and I just ignored it, but my co-worker lamented that he spent the whole day trying to get through to his broker. He was lucky he didn't! He would have lost a lot selling in a panic, but he cooled down and just held onto it after that, and came out ok.

What you kiddoes are doing is pretty cool though, and it's true that y'all are deep into stocks at a much earlier age than was even possible before. I've been following wsb for a while, and even made some money off of their tips. One thing I love about what you're doing is that you aren't afraid of losing money.

The only way to really learn is to put money into it. Before you do that, it's just all to abstract to care about, but once your own money is at stake, you become hyper aware, your brain becomes far more able to absorb knowledge and data, and to achieve some understanding of what's going on.

One thing I find funny is that the local news stations are all treating this as one of their lite, smiley stories. It's great to see these GenX newscasters cheerily talking about ""Wall Street Bets"", subreddits, Robinhood, short selling, and hedge funds like ""Oh those cute l'il Zoomers!"" They have interviews with local investors (I'm in Dallas), and they're all ""Well, it's great to see young people getting so involved in investing. I just hope they don't lose too much money at it <chuckle>.""

I guess what I'm saying is, the underlying attitude is ""Yeah, fuck those hedge fund managers!"" Nobody is calling wsb ""financial terrorists"" or anything like you might expect.",t3_l7awnp

1032,gl7yr7o,t3_l7awnp,"I'll never forget the only time my job was threatened.

I worked in a financial data provider. We provided many investment firms, funds, banks, etc with their data. Currencies trade constantly. The close price for a currency is the last reported trade for the day, within a specific timezone. The year end close - i.e. the last trade of the year - is especially important as it is used in a lot of different calculations and valuations for offshore funds.

One new years day I received a call telling me that the year end close for one currency was wrong. WTF does that even mean? I logged on, and had a look at the logs and timeseries. Everything looked mostly normal. There was a bit of volatility, which was unusual to happen leading up to midnight, but not unheard of. I checked our competitors and other sources and saw the exact same figure. 

I replied back saying that the data was correct, provided trades leading up to and after the trade used for the end-of-year close. There was like a percent spread over a time period. Nothing worry some at all. Except to the fund manager. 

Their fee was based on their fund's performance. And their fund had underperformed to a point that the 1% difference in the close they wanted versus were given meant that they couldn't pay themselves that fee (and also had to explain to their investors). 

I couldn't care about their issues. The data was correct and I closed the issue. An hour later I received a call from my boss. I explained the situation. I could have changed the data (I was one of 3 who had the rights), but correcting data was done rarely. A half hour after that, I received a call from my boss and his boss. We spoke about it. I was asked how quickly I could change the data. I lied and said it would take many hours, but it took me a few seconds. If we changed the end of year close, we'd have to notify all customers of the change. And explain why we had to do it. And get them to redo all of their calculations on their models, valuations, etc.

The third phone call included the c-level. And I was flat out given a choice: Change the data or change my job. 

That fund manager bitched and whined and moaned to our company owners enough that the execs got shat on, and of course we know in which direction shit flows.

So I changed it. And I let all our account managers know. And they spent weeks apologizing for all the additional work that the change that created a load of work for all our other clients who used that data.

1037,glttqnz,t3_l7awnp,"This was my post to my fb community (and in the FB post i had to take out the stock names...I think fb was blocking GME and AMC traffic too...):

How is it that no one is posting about $GME $AMC did all you armchair activists all get up to take a shit at the same time??

This is likely to be the only actual redistribution of wealth in your lifetime (in anyone's) so I will explain: 

A market analyst who'd been tracking GME (gamestop) since 2018 started buying long everytime he noticed hedge funds going short and ended up exposing the most significant bit of publicly available wall street corruption since 2007. Wall street fund managers had been colluding using a market vehicle called a short which is a bet against a company. But with the billions  available to a hedge fund they can actually devalue the company with such a technique, and with each penny change in stock price they made millions (or more) and then passed it off to another fund that made millions in the next penny decline. The result of this being so successful that wall street actually had more short positions outstanding than GME had shares outstanding...enter the analyst who'd been buying the shares and over 2 years following the stock who calls out this illegal collusion AND the precarious position the hedge funds created for themselves. 

Due to their short positions, at some point the hedge funds legally have to (literally) buy the stock at a later date. If you or I or Jenny from the block all hold the shares of stock, they have to buy it from us. If you hold it and wait, the price will go up because demand is increasing and with time their positions get more precarious, and ultimately they will stop waiting us out and start competing with other hedge funds to buy out these shorts as quickly as possible. And they spend the millions they made devaluing the stocks to pay you at  the higher prices the market now demands for stocks like GME and AMC, and the result is that prices go up and then the next fund buys before it's too late and instead of our 401ks getting ruined it is their I'll gotten hedge fund gains being depleted. Caveats apply and guaranteed they are trying to avoid this with nefarious and  political/regulatory means but:

In short (get it??) they are stuck having to pay you with the money they've been scamming from you since they crashed the economy and got bailed out for in 2007-2009. And they will do this by selling the ""reliable"" long stocks that are too popular to easily manipulate like APPL or AMZN and when they take billions out of those stocks to pay you for your shares of GME to cover the positions they are legally bound to cover. As a result the prices of stocks AAPL and most other stocks will artificially decline. And since you have all that money they just paid you for GME or AMC you can then buy AAPL or AMZN at a deep discount, locking in your position there the same way wall street had previously locked you out. So in the end, you own a piece of the stack market that previously had only been accessible to wall street.

At least in theory. Markets are volatile and this will be a financial battleground individuals always get screwed by the institutions somehow. This isn't financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor,  and I can't give you financial advice. 

What I will say is this: Pundits, politicians, and propagandists (and stock brokers) love a dose of modern activism  because it means donations and click throughs and campaign funds which means revenue which means job security which means their hedge funds get filled and their hedge fund managers collect fees and nothing changes for the people your intention or donation was intended to help. It's a system that the elite use to keep themselves elite and there is no trickle down except for the occasional feint they use to placate the masses like the affordable care act which still makes ""them"" more money than it benefits anyone else. But if the system breaks and we end up owning a larger piece of wall street than the general population has ever owned in history, they will reevaluate and change the system that caused them losses. and this moment in history represents a chance to have a voice and a share in that change because we can own it. It's quite literally taking the power back. not for a week or a month or an election cycle but for generations.

Don't occupy wall street. Democratize wall street. 

TLDR? Smh.

1064,gl8i7wj,t3_l7awnp,"\#ICYMI, these hedge funds and their large banking and brokerage partners (which proliferate shorts by lending out the shares to enable such scams) are *bigly* funding politicians, and I'm not just talking Citizens United or your garden variety super PACs. There's the board seats, the lobbying positions, the speaking fees, the consultant gigs and [Bob's your uncle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_your_uncle) careers for the public servant's spouse, partner, mistress, toy-boy, child, or relative, and the list goes on.

In return, there's little regulation, and if somebody gets caught, it'll be a slap on the wrist, *usually with no admission of wrongdoing*. They're basically cutting the government an extra check for a small share of the take when they get too greedy and get caught.

Here's a trivia question for you: Do you know how many bankers went to prison for their part in the 2008 market crash?

In Iceland: 25.

In the US: 1 (one), and that [fall guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Serageldin) was an Egyptian immigrant working for a Swiss bank.

He pled guilty in 2013 to *conspiracy to falsify books and records* and received 30 months quality time in federal housing. The SDNY prosecutors had asked for 45 years.

Oh, and one year later in 2014, same fall guy [settled with the SEC](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-21/ex-credit-suisse-cdo-chief-must-pay-more-than-1-million) to the tune of $1M. His salary in 2007 alone was $7.1M. The damages on the other hand came in at appr. $540M. In other words, the aforementioned slap on the wrist.

To paraphrase Louis Rossmann, that's the equivalent of parking meters on your street charging 10 bucks per hour, but the parking ticket's just a quarter and the meter maid shows up maybe once a year. Normal people feed the meters, hedge funds wait for the ticket in the mail.

So don't be surprised that Robinhood, who *allegedly* makes 40% of their revenue lending their customers stocks out to Melvin Capital, and who yesterday banned retail investors from buying volatile stocks right around the time when Citadel (who had just [injected $2B](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/citadel-point72-to-invest-275-billion-in-melvin-capital) into Melvin) *allegedly* doubled down on shorts, will end up with a slap on the wrist, some sourpuss faces during congressional hearings, and maybe a new CEO for Robinhood, Melvin Capital, and Citadel.

Fun fact: Gabriel Plotkin, the founder and CIO of Melvin Capital, had already been [investigated by the SEC back in 2013](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS310089300120130403) for insider trading, left the crime scene at SAC Capital unscathed, and started his own Wall Street shakedown operation back in 2014.

Bonus fun fact: Janet Yellen, the former Federal Reserve vice-chair, who just got confirmed with 84-15 votes in the US Senate as the next treasury secretary, received [$810K from Citadel](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/yellen-robinhood-citadel-gamestop-speaking-fees) during 2018 to 2020. Oh, and according to a whistleblower, *allegedly* somebody from the White House had called Robinhood before the barred their customers from buying stocks *allegedly* still shorted by Melvin Capital and *allegedly* now also Citadel.

IMHO, if you want to revert a nation back from an [Oligarchy](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746) to a functioning democracy, elections must be, above and beyond limited private donations, government-funded (meaning limited funds, reimbursed based on election results) with *no exceptions* for corporations, campaign windows limited, TV airtime balanced, guaranteed, and *fact-checked*. Oh, and if you're not the guy running for office, you can't buy an ad for that guy on social media. Make it a law; I dare you, I *double-dare* you, Mo...

Bonus IMHO: Stop this bullshit to register for a party during voter registration. You want to be a member of a political party, join the party, let that party run their primaries on their own dime and time, but stop registering your affiliation with the government, it's none of their fucking business. Once that's out of the way, automatic voter registration is a no-brainer - as it is in most other developed countries on this planet.

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD HOLD HOLD! DONT GET PAPER HANDS DURING THE LAST HOUR, ITS WHAT THEY WANT!

they have to have funds to funds the transaction. they are claiming they ran out of funds or were afraid of the risk that they wouldn't eventually get your $100. 

DTC began requiring 100% funds to back up trades for certain stocks because of how volatile the tradng has been and were worried about a co-party crash (Melvin > Citadel > DTC).

What happens if a lot of very large hedgefunds go bankrupt tomorrow?  What does this cause across the market?

We know a lot of funds and the game is rigged, it was proved today.  We know a lot of this is corrupt beyond measure and that these people are the shittest humans ever that only play when the game is unfair and take the ball and go home when they can't control the outcome.

But here is the big problem, all that money they control isn't just those individuals, it is money from pension funds, it is money from massive amounts of families....

1. Can you explain a bit more how this would have spread to the rest of the market?

GME isn't going to a trillion dollars Market Cap)
2. Can't Gamestop themselves issue or dilute and therefore drive the price down while raising capital?
3. Can't the firm(s) who are deep in shorts, decide to close up shop and declare bankruptcy?
4. Couldn't they repeat today's action to continue to depress the price in a slow methodical manner, while closing out their shorts?

1380,gl734k2,t1_gl62h4y,"i'm not a stocks guy, but i've seen a few videos explaining parts of this.  the ending explanation is a big grandiose.

when you short a stock, these are the literal steps:

- you borrow the stock now and sell it for $20
- you buy it later for $5
- you keep the profit of $15

if the time between borrow, sell, and buy is quick then it doesn't matter.  but if it takes a long time between and buy, the actual end of it, you have to pay an interest payment on it.  like you would any loan thing.

BUUUUUUT, what if you try to do a short and this happens

- borrow the stock and sell it at $20
- wait and............stock goes to $500?!??!?!? fuck what?
- ok so do i sell it now or try to wait more and see if it goes down to 5 like i thought it would?

so if you sell NOW, you lock in that you lose $480 per share.  OR, you keep the share AND you have to pay interest on this ""loaned"" out share that you got in the first place.

so all these hedge funds that shorted the GME stock, and have not sold the share yet, still have the loan, and are getting charged an interest on this loaned share.

so reddit users just sitting here owning this piece of stock, doing nothing the fuck else, is costing wall street tons of fucking money.  so as we saw this single bad overreach that brought down this one hedgefund already, it could have lasting affects on other funds too.  that's the big ripple effect he's talking about.",t3_l7awnp

>why is short interest on GME still so high even today?

As others have said...they are all in now. If they get out now, they're done. Their fund, their career, everything. At this point they have nothing to left to lose. Either they fold now and lose everything, or they stay in the game long enough to mess with the rules and maybe salvage this.

If people don't wind up in jail, you will finally see an actual general strike. I fucking hate rose twitter socialists and I'll stand with them after this shit.

Give us back price discovery and an economy that prioritizes productivity instead of fundamentally prioritizing inefficient jobs i.e. paying people to dig holes 'because they increase aggregate demand'.

There’s a pretty high chance that if a stimulus bill made it to his desk, it wouldn’t pass with a veto proof majority, so Trump would probably veto it and the stimulus bill would die.

I believe that if he lost, he’d veto it at every opportunity it makes it to his desk, and since it’s very unlikely that a bill would pass the senate with a veto proof majority, everyone would probably just wait until the next congressional terms and next presidential term to try again with Joe Biden and whatever the new Senate and House of Representatives looks like.

And the rules are written to favor the candidates the two major parties prefer, and to disfavor any minor parties catching up to them. And all the while the media mostly supports these two parties and their chosen candidates. 

It’s not exactly rigged, but it’s also not any kind of fair and square situation. They two parties have every incentive against fair and square—and both parties operate this way.

No one gets to vote for who they want, the government ends up being representative of nobody, and all we’re left with is big party infighting, widening partisan gaps, and increasingly disillusioned voters who feel like the system is inherently broken, which pushes them either into political apathy or radical reformation, neither of which are healthy for our country.
