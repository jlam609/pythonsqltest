#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

2584,gl1317k,t1_gl09yaq,"Well, the article has this passage:

> Except that this time, amateur investors decided to revolt against the pros. Using Reddit -- and a subreddit known as r/wallstreetbets -- the amateurs began a coordinated effort of buying GameStop stock to drive its price higher and higher. (It's worth noting that Reddit was also a gathering spot for some of the most ardent Trump supporters in 2016.)

I don't know you, but that last line in parenthesis seems specifically crafted to associate r/wallstreetbets with r/the_donald.

Edit: also missed this one.

> (Musk has also been a longtime critic of social media censoring and was a prominent Covid-19 skeptic. Sound like anyone else we know?)

They are specifically trying to equate fucking Elon Musk to Trump!",t3_l6e0kt

You're listening to lo-fi while you eat your tendies and jack off over green candles.

Suddenly a gun shot from out of nowhere, and the music stutters, then stops.

You flip to the YouTube tab, and see a suited man standing over your lo-fi waifu's corpse. Chair toppled over, blood everywhere on the desk, body on the ground.

The suited man doesn't match the art style. It looks like someone photoshopped a real picture onto the scene. He is just staring directly at the camera, seeming to gaze at the user. No emotion on his face.",t3_l6e0kt
